## Phase 5: Polish & Launch

**Goal**: Performance optimization, SEO hardening, accessibility audit, and production readiness.

### 5.1 Performance Audit
- [ ] Run Lighthouse on key pages: home/map, bean detail, bean list, learn articles
- [ ] Target scores: Performance 90+, Accessibility 95+, Best Practices 95+, SEO 95+
- [ ] Measure Core Web Vitals: LCP < 2.5s, FID < 100ms, CLS < 0.1
- [ ] Identify and address largest contentful paint bottleneck (likely Mapbox JS)
- [ ] Profile React rendering with React DevTools Profiler

### 5.2 Bundle Optimization
- [ ] Install `@next/bundle-analyzer`, analyze output
- [ ] Dynamic imports for heavy components:
  - `CoffeeMap` (Mapbox GL JS ~200KB gzipped)
  - `FlavorWheel` (D3 subset)
  - `ComparisonView`
  - `BrewTimer`
- [ ] Tree-shake D3: import only `d3-hierarchy`, `d3-shape`, `d3-scale`, `d3-selection`
- [ ] Verify no full lodash/moment imports (use date-fns, native methods)
- [ ] Target: initial JS bundle < 200KB gzipped

### 5.3 Image Optimization
- [ ] Convert all bean hero images to WebP format, generate AVIF variants
- [ ] Use Next.js `<Image>` component everywhere with:
  - `placeholder="blur"` with generated blur data URLs
  - Responsive `sizes` attribute
  - Lazy loading for below-fold images
- [ ] Compress all images: target < 100KB per hero image
- [ ] Total image budget for initial viewport: < 500KB

### 5.4 Map Performance
- [ ] Measure GeoJSON file sizes, simplify further if > 1MB total
- [ ] Consider Mapbox vector tilesets for region boundaries if client-side GeoJSON is too heavy
- [ ] Implement `useDeferredValue` for filter state to prevent map jank during rapid filter changes
- [ ] Debounce viewport sync to URL (300ms) to avoid excessive history entries
- [ ] Test on low-end devices (throttled CPU/network in DevTools)

### 5.5 SEO
- [ ] Generate dynamic `sitemap.xml` at build time (all bean pages, learn pages, static pages)
- [ ] Create `robots.txt` (allow all, point to sitemap)
- [ ] Add JSON-LD structured data to bean pages (Product or Dataset schema)
- [ ] Unique meta title and description for every page
- [ ] Canonical URLs on all pages
- [ ] Submit to Google Search Console, verify indexing
- [ ] Test with Google Rich Results Test

### 5.6 Accessibility Audit
- [ ] Full keyboard navigation audit: every interactive element reachable and operable via keyboard
- [ ] Screen reader testing with VoiceOver (macOS) and NVDA (Windows)
- [ ] Run `axe-core` automated audit on all pages, fix all violations
- [ ] Map accessibility: provide a hidden bean list as an equivalent non-visual navigation method
- [ ] All images have descriptive `alt` text
- [ ] Radar charts and flavor wheel include screen-reader-only data tables
- [ ] Color contrast: verify all text meets WCAG 2.1 AA (4.5:1 body, 3:1 large)
- [ ] Focus indicators: visible ring on all interactive elements
- [ ] `prefers-reduced-motion` disables all animations
- [ ] Skip-to-content link for keyboard users
- [ ] Aria labels on all icon-only buttons

### 5.7 Error Handling
- [ ] Add React Error Boundaries around: Map component, visualization components, auth-dependent sections
- [ ] Graceful fallback UI for map loading failures (Mapbox token issues, network errors)
- [ ] Custom 404 page for invalid bean slugs and routes
- [ ] Custom 500 page for server errors
- [ ] API route error responses with proper status codes and messages
- [ ] Toast notifications for user-facing errors (favoriting fails, share fails, etc.)

### 5.8 Analytics
- [ ] Add Vercel Analytics for Web Vitals monitoring
- [ ] Add Plausible Analytics (or Vercel Web Analytics) for page views (privacy-friendly, no cookies)
- [ ] Track key events: bean viewed, brew method selected, filter applied, comparison made, favorite added, share clicked
- [ ] Dashboard for monitoring engagement and popular beans

### 5.9 PWA Basics
- [ ] Create `manifest.json` with app name, icons, theme color, display: standalone
- [ ] Add to root layout `<head>`
- [ ] Configure service worker with `@ducanh2912/next-pwa` or `next-pwa`
- [ ] Cache strategies:
  - Bean data JSON: cache-first (update in background)
  - Images: cache-first with stale-while-revalidate
  - Educational content: cache-first
  - Map tiles: network-first (Mapbox handles its own caching)
- [ ] Offline fallback page for when network is unavailable
- [ ] Test add-to-homescreen on iOS and Android

### 5.10 End-to-End Tests
- [ ] Set up Playwright with test fixtures
- [ ] Critical flow tests:
  - [ ] Land on map -> markers visible -> click marker -> bean panel opens with correct data
  - [ ] Apply filters -> markers fade -> clear filters -> all markers return
  - [ ] Cmd+K search -> type bean name -> select result -> map flies to bean
  - [ ] Open brew recommendation -> view full details -> use dose calculator
  - [ ] Add 2 beans to comparison -> open comparison view -> radar chart overlays
  - [ ] Toggle dark/light mode -> map and UI update
  - [ ] Navigate to bean detail page -> all sections render -> "View on Map" works
  - [ ] Mobile: bottom sheet opens and drags between snap points
- [ ] Run in CI (GitHub Actions) on push to main
- [ ] Visual regression tests for key components (optional: Playwright screenshots)

### 5.11 Documentation
- [ ] Write README.md:
  - Project overview and screenshots
  - Tech stack summary
  - Local development setup instructions
  - Environment variables guide
  - Project structure overview
  - Data contribution guide (how to add new beans to `beans.json`)
  - Deployment instructions (Vercel)
- [ ] Add CONTRIBUTING.md with code style, PR process, data quality guidelines
- [ ] Add LICENSE (MIT or similar)

### 5.12 Production Launch
- [ ] Final deploy to Vercel production environment
- [ ] Set up custom domain (e.g., brewmap.coffee or brew-map.vercel.app)
- [ ] Verify all pages load correctly in production
- [ ] Verify OG images, sitemap, robots.txt in production
- [ ] Test on real mobile devices (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)
- [ ] Submit sitemap to Google Search Console
- [ ] Create launch announcement / social media posts

### Phase 5 Verification
- [ ] Lighthouse scores: Performance 90+, Accessibility 95+, Best Practices 95+, SEO 95+
- [ ] Core Web Vitals pass in Vercel Analytics
- [ ] All Playwright E2E tests pass in CI
- [ ] Full keyboard navigation works across all pages
- [ ] VoiceOver reads all content meaningfully
- [ ] PWA installs and works offline (cached content)
- [ ] No console errors or warnings in production build
- [ ] Custom domain resolves and HTTPS works
- [ ] OG images render correctly when shared on Twitter/Facebook/LinkedIn
